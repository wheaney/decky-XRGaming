Install and configure the [XREAL Air Linux driver](https://github.com/wheaney/xrealAirLinuxDriver) without having to leave Gaming Mode. Once installed, the driver allows for tracking the head movements as mouse or joystick controller movements, which produces VR-like camera movements in some games.

## How it works

This plugin installs and keeps you up-to-date with the latest version of the driver. Going into the plugin settings allows you to disable the driver or configure its behavior.

## Configuration Options

From the plugin settings, you can control the following:
* **Enable/disable the driver**. When disabled, your Air glasses will be display-only, no head movements will be tracked.
* **Mouse vs joystick mode**. In mouse-mode, head movements are translated to mouse movements, while in joystick-mode, they're translated to right-joystick movements on a virtual controller.
* **Mouse sensitivity**. In mouse-mode, this setting controls how much/quickly the mouse will move relative to your head movements.

## Decky Loader

This plugin requires [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader). XREAL Air Driver is available on the store.
